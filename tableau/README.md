# ðŸ“Š Tableau Dashboards for Analysis

As part of the project, we created several Tableau dashboards to visually analyze and summarize key patterns from the cleaned SPARCS healthcare dataset.

Below are the published Tableau links:

- ðŸ”— [Dashboard 1: Overview Statistics](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sumedha.komawar/viz/DataHackathondashboard1/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

- ðŸ”— [Dashboard 2: Severity of Illness vs Cost](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sumedha.komawar/viz/DataHackathondashboard2/Dashboard2?publish=yes)

- ðŸ”— [Dashboard 3: Hospital Wise Mean Costs](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sumedha.komawar/viz/DataHackathondashboard2/Dashboard3?publish=yes)

### ðŸ“ˆ Each dashboard highlights different aspects:

- **Dashboard 1**: Overall discharge patterns, mean and median costs across the years.
- **Dashboard 2**: Comparative visualization of mean costs categorized by severity of illness.
- **Dashboard 3**: Hospital-wise comparison of average discharge costs to identify high-cost institutions.

These visualizations complement our machine learning model by offering additional insights into healthcare trends.
