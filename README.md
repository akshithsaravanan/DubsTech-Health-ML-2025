ðŸ“Œ DubsTech Health ML 2025 - Predicting Hospital Discharge Costs
Problem Statement
We aim to predict the mean cost of hospital discharges across New York State based on key hospital, diagnosis, severity, and case characteristics.
Accurately predicting healthcare costs helps hospitals plan better budgets, improve resource allocation, and enhance affordability.

Dataset
